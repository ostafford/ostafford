<h2>🎯 What Drives Me</h2>

Look, I'm not here to save the world with code. I'm just trying to make things a bit easier, a bit smarter. My projects, like Bupget, are about solving real problems - the kind of stuff that makes daily life just a little less complicated.

I believe in the power of small wins. Not grand, sweeping changes, but the tiny improvements that actually stick. Whether it's helping someone track their finances better or automate a frustrating process, I'm all about creating practical solutions that give people back their time and mental space.

Software isn't magic. It's a tool. And I'm here to use that tool to help people do what they do, just a bit more efficiently.

<h3>💡 My Coding Philosophy</h3>

Code is more than just lines on a screen - it's a way to solve real-world problems, tell stories, and maybe have a bit of fun along the way. I'm not just learning to code; I'm learning to create, innovate, and hopefully make something that puts a smile on someone's face! 🤗
